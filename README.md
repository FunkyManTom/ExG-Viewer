# ExG-Viewer
Small Python script allowing to view root based matrices and gate them diagonally. Mainly build to view ExG matrices. 

Load a .root file and select which matrix to view. If you want to you can additionally load the levels of a isotope of interest. This requires no additional local files instead pulling the data directly from the IAEA database.
The loaded matrix can be gated diagonally and the resulting count is shown in the right window.
